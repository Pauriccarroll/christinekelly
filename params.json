Years later I tell him the stories\r\nof what his brother-in-law did to me, and\r\n\r\nhe wipes a tear from the corner of his eye,\r\nwraps it in a white handkerchief for church,\r\nwalks up the stairs with the aluminum\r\ncrutch to scream at the feet of black Jesus\r\nand in these brittle years of his old age we\r\ngrow deeper, talk way after midnight,\r\npeeping over the rail of his hospital bed\r\nas we wash the twilight blue Chevrolet.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
